/**
 * This class implements a ScalaTest test suite for the methods in object
 * `Lists` that need to be implemented as part of this assignment. A test
 * suite is simply a collection of individual tests for some specific
 * component of a program.
 *
 * A test suite is created by defining a class which extends the type
 * `org.scalatest.FunSuite`. When running ScalaTest, it will automatically
 * find this class and execute all of its tests.
 *
 * Adding the `@RunWith` annotation enables the test suite to be executed
 * inside eclipse using the built-in JUnit test runner.
 *
 * You have two options for running this test suite:
 *
 * - Start the sbt console and run the "test" command
 * - Right-click this file in eclipse and chose "Run As" - "JUnit Test"

   * Tests are written using the `test` operator which takes two arguments:
   *
   * - A description of the test. This description has to be unique, no two
   *   tests can have the same description.
   * - The test body, a piece of Scala code that implements the test
   *
   * The most common way to implement a test body is using the method `assert`
   * which tests that its argument evaluates to `true`. So one of the simplest
   * successful tests is the following:

   * In Scala, it is allowed to pass an argument to a method using the block
   * syntax, i.e. `{ argument }` instead of parentheses `(argument)`.
   *
   * This allows tests to be written in a more readable manner:

   * One problem with the previous (failing) test is that ScalaTest will
   * only tell you that a test failed, but it will not tell you what was
   * the reason for the failure. The output looks like this:
   *
   * {{{
   *    [info] - one plus one is three? *** FAILED ***
   * }}}
   *
   * This situation can be improved by using a special equality operator
   * `===` instead of `==` (this is only possible in ScalaTest). So if you
   * run the next test, ScalaTest will show the following output:
   *
   * {{{
   *    [info] - details why one plus one is not three *** FAILED ***
   *    [info]   2 did not equal 3 (ListsSuite.scala:67)
   * }}}
   *
   * We recommend to always use the `===` equality operator when writing tests.

   * In order to test the exceptional behavior of a methods, ScalaTest offers

   * throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if its argument is `0`.
