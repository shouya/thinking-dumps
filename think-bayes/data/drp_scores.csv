# Description: Results of an experiment to test whether directed
# reading activities in the classroom help elementary school students
# improve aspects of their reading ability. A treatment class of 21
# third-grade students participated in these activities for eight weeks,
# and a control class of 23 third-graders followed the same curriculum
# without the activities. After the eight-week period, students in both
# classes took a Degree of Reading Power (DRP) test which measures the
# aspects of reading ability that the treatment is designed to improve.

# Variable Names: 

# Treatment: Whether student participated in activities (treated) or
  not (control)

# Response: Score on Degree of Reading Power test
